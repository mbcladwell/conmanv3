Dear Baozhu,
Your recent article entitled "Label-free fluorescence strategy for methyltransferase activity assay based on poly-thymine copper nanoclusters engineered by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase." in the journal Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy suggests you might benefit from our product.
Visit Laboratory Automation Solutions at www.labsolns.com and learn how LIMS*Nucleus can help you.

LIMS*Nucleus can:

-Reformat plates - four 96 well plates into a 384 well plate; four 384 well plates into a 1536 well plate
-Associate assay data with plate sets
-Identify hits scoring in assays using included algorithms - or write your own
-Export annotated data
-Generate worklists for liquid handling robots
-Rearray hits into a smaller collection of plates
-Track samples

LIMS*Nucleus can serve as the core of a LIMS system.
Prototype algorithms, dashboards, visualizations with R/Shiny.
